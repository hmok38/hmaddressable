# Addressables Samples
The Addressables package provides a few samples that can be downloaded into your project.  Samples are accessed via **Window** > **Package Manager** > **Addressables**.

These samples include examples on how to disable asset importing during a build, creating custom build and playmode scripts, as well as providing an `AddressableUtility` class.

When a sample is downloaded and imported, it is placed inside the `Assets/Samples/Addressables/{AddressablesVersionNumber}` path of your project.
