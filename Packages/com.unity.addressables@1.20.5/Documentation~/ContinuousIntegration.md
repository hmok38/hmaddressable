# Continuous integration

You can use a Continuous Integration (CI) system to perform your Addressables content builds and your application player builds. This section provides general guidelines for building Addressables with CI systems, but note that every project has its own requirements and constraints, so some guidelines might not apply in all cases.

## Selecting a content builder

One of the main choices when building Addressables content is selecting a content builder. By default, if you call [AddressableAssetSettings.BuildPlayerContent()] it uses the `BuildScriptPackedMode` script as the [IDataBuilder] instance. The `BuildPlayerContent()` function checks the [ActivePlayerDataBuilder] setting and calls into that script's `BuildDataImplementation(..)`  

If you've implemented your own custom [IDataBuilder] and want to use it for your CI builds, set the [ActivePlayerDataBuilderIndex] property of [AddressableAssetSettings]. By default, you can access the correct settings instance through [AddressableAssetSettingsDefaultObject.Settings]. This index refers to the position of the `IDataBuilder` in the list of [AddressableAssetSettings.DataBuilders]. The following code sample demonstrates how to set a custom `IDataBuilder`:

[!code-cs[sample](../Tests/Editor/DocExampleCode/CustomDataBuilder.cs#doc_SetCustomBuilder)]

<!--
``` csharp
public static void SetCustomDataBuilder(IDataBuilder builder)
{ 
    AddressableAssetSettings settings 
        = AddressableAssetSettingsDefaultObject.Settings;
    
    int index = settings.DataBuilders.IndexOf((ScriptableObject) builder);
    if (index > 0)
        settings.ActivePlayerDataBuilderIndex = index;
    else if (AddressableAssetSettingsDefaultObject.Settings.AddDataBuilder(builder))
        settings.ActivePlayerDataBuilderIndex = AddressableAssetSettingsDefaultObject.Settings.DataBuilders.Count - 1;
    else
        Debug.LogWarning($"{builder} could not be found or added to the list of DataBuilders");
}
```
-->

## Cleaning the Addressables content builder cache

[IDataBuilder] implementations define a [ClearCachedData()] method, which cleans up any files created by that data builder. For example, the default `BuildScriptPackedMode` script deletes the following:
- The content catalog
- The serialized settings file
- The built AssetBundles
- Any link.xml files created

You can call `IDataBuilder.ClearCachedData()` as part of your CI process to make sure the build does not use files generated by previous builds.

## Cleaning the Scriptable Build Pipeline cache
Cleaning the Scriptable Build Pipeline (SBP) cache cleans the `BuildCache` folder from the `Library` directory along with all the hash maps generated by the build and the Type Database. The `Library/BuildCache` folder contains `.info` files created by SBP during the build which speeds up subsequent builds by reading data from these `.info` files instead of re-generating data that hasn't changed.

To clear the SBP cache in a script without opening a prompt dialog, call [BuildCache.PurgeCache(false)].
