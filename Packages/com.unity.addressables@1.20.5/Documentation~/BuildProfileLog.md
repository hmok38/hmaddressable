# Build Profiling

The Addressables build process always creates a .json log file that contains build performance information. You can find the log file in your project folder at `Library/com.unity.addressables/AddressablesBuildTEP.json`.

View the log file with the chrome://tracing tool in Google Chrome or another [Chromium]-based browser.
