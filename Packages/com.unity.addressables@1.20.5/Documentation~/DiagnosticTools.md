# Diagnostic tools

The Addressables packages provides the following tools for analyzing your Addressables setup, performance, and build results:

* [Analyze tool]\: provides a set of utilities and reports that you can use to find and fix asset duplication and to see how the system packs the assets in your groups into bundles. The reports and utilities include the following (you can also create your own analyze rule classes to produce additional reports): 
  * Check Duplicate Bundle Dependencies
  * Check Resources to Addressable Duplicate Dependencies
  * Check Scene to Addressable Duplicate Dependencies
  * Bundle Layout Preview
* [Event viewer]: provides a runtime profile view of your Addressable operations, including asset loading and unloading.
* [Build layout report]: describes how Addressables packs the assets in your groups into AssetBundles.
* [Build profile log]: provides a build-time profiling file that you can view in a Chromium-based browser.
